# LogicVoice

Voice-first AI companion for program design and Logical Framework creation.
## Step 1: Core Outputs (Locked)

This system must produce the following three outputs from user conversations:
1. Logical Framework (LFA table)
2. Spreadsheet-ready program plan
3. Professional narrative text for donors
## Logical Framework Structure

The Logical Framework captures program logic in a structured form.
It answers:
- Why the program exists
- What changes will happen
- What work will be done
- How success will be measured
### LFA Components

1. Goal
   - One long-term objective
   - Describes the overall improvement expected

2. Outcomes
   - Specific, measurable changes
   - Describe what will be different for beneficiaries

3. Indicators
   - Quantitative or qualitative measures
   - Used to track outcomes

4. Means of Verification
   - Data sources for indicators

5. Outputs
   - Concrete deliverables or actions
   - Direct results of program activities

6. Activities
   - Ground-level tasks performed

7. Responsibility
   - Who is accountable

8. Monitoring
   - How implementation is tracked
### Example (Human Language)

If a user says:
"Teachers will be trained and block officers will review progress monthly"

Then:
- "Teachers will be trained" → Output
- "Block officers" → Responsibility
- "Review progress monthly" → Monitoring
